# DevOps_Aaalto
This repo is created for DevOps course held by Aalto university.

General overview of course
This course provides an introduction to DevOps by covering both related technologies and software development practices. Additional information is available in the course syllabus. The course takes place entirely online and is mostly based on independent learning supported by both the provided material and the online modules.

The course material is available under the corresponding section in the MyCourses workspace of the course (the one you are currently viewing) and consists of different types of curated resources, ranging from documents, videos, and other material freely available over the Internet. Hands-on resources to complete the project are available under tutorials.

Online modules include a project and a questionnaire, the latter available through the A+ learning management system. The project consists in applying practices and technologies related to DevOps to build a simple personal website; questions(either single- or multiple-choice) are related to the course material. The questionnaire is automatically graded and the corresponding results are provided by the system as soon as the submission is processed.

Code of conduct
Projects and exercises are individual work: do not copy or even read the solutions written by others; address the questions independently and do the project yourselves. Sharing project material and solutions to questionnaires with others is strictly forbidden. Remember that episodes of plagiarism and collusion are fraudulent means in studying according to the Aalto University Code of Academic Integrity which may result in caution or suspension. See also the code of conduct of the course for more details. 

Assessment
The course is graded as either pass or fail. To pass the course you must fulfil both requirements below.

Complete the project by complying with the related specifications.
Obtain at least 20 points from the online questionnaires.
The point value above is indicative: the actual threshold for passing could be relaxed at the end of the course. Online questionnaires give up to 40 points. The corresponding online module has an opening date, a submission deadline as well as a late submission deadline. The module allows a one-week late submission with 25% point penalty.

A+ workspace of the course
The A+ workspace of the course will be available soon. You must enroll in the course the first time you visit the corresponding page. Note that this is not the official enrollment to the course but just a necessary step to access the online modules: after clicking the Enrol button on A+ you have to fill-in the enrollment questionnaire and then you can reach the course workspace. Its main page shows the online modules and the related information, including the opening time, the standard and late submission deadlines, and the total number of points currently obtained in that module. The same page also shows the number of points together with the thresholds for the minimum number of points to be obtained. The left side of the page has a menu with links to different resources for quick reference; they also include a link to the MyCourse page and the Zulip chat of the course.
